The 1st case seems easy to solve (just do all hospitals), but the 2nd case needs an algorithm to optimize cost b/w hospitals AND highways. I looked into priority queues and minimum spanning trees, but neither seems like it would really help in an efficient way. |
| Sep 11 | 10:00-10:30am | I started considering a recursive algorithm with 2 paths for each move: adding a hospital or just adding a highway. But I don't think this would be super efficient. I spent more time breaking down the problem. I need to figure out the # of clusters per set of nodes, and then from there, the cost calculation should be pretty simple. Each cluster needs 1 hospital, so get the cost of that, then get the cost of the minimum # of highways. But the biggest challenge of this is: how can I find # of clusters? My instinct is to use a nested for loop and an arraylist within an arraylist. |
